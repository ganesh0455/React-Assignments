    Import and exports
------------------------

In modern JS, a function, object, component, variable (anything it can be)  are defined in one file and if you want to use it in another file we have to export and import it. Thatâ€™s how those two files will be connected and we can use them.

        JSX
-------------------------

It is a html like syntax inside a java script file.it is a special syntax introduced by the React team.
Even Though it looks like html it is actually a Java script and behind the scenes the Babel will convert that JSX code into normal java script. Like the image below.
