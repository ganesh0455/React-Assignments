------------------------
    Import and exports
------------------------

In modern JS, a function, object, component, variable (anything it can be)  are defined in one file and if you want to use it in another file we have to export and import it. Thatâ€™s how those two files will be connected and we can use them.


-------------------------
        JSX
-------------------------

It is a html like syntax inside a java script file.it is a special syntax introduced by the React team.
Even Though it looks like html it is actually a Java script and behind the scenes the Babel will convert that JSX code into normal java script. Like the image below.

-------------------------
How React works
-------------------------
We can build our own custome HTML elements.this is also called as Components. 
React is all about components.the components is a combination of HTML,CSS and JS.
React is a declarative approach.Which means it will not say the instructions to be added to the DOM imperatively. It will just say declaratively, means we are declaring one particular structure of how DOM should be.
Which means we Define the desired target state(s) and now react took that (state) declarative instructions and React figure out the actual java script DOM instructions.
